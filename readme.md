After getting my hands on java I thought to make a telegram bot in java, so I made this.
### TODO-BOT

Just a simple todo bot which can do the following things.
Use the following commands to use this bot😁

```
1. /todo (your todo name) 🙂
2. /show to show added todo list 🤩
3. /alert to get todo alerts 😌
4. /cancel to cancel the alerts 😶
5. /delete to delete your todo 😛
```
